### Configuration Details:
```xml
SonarCloud Plugin Version: 3.10.0.2594
JaCoCo Plugin Version: 0.8.11
Java Version: 17
Project Key: namgay282004_ci-cd-a
Organization: namgay282004
```

### Next Steps Required:
- [ ] Create SonarCloud account at https://sonarcloud.io
- [ ] Generate SonarCloud API token
- [ ] Add `SONAR_TOKEN` to GitHub repository secrets
- [ ] Add `SONAR_ORGANIZATION` to GitHub repository secrets
- [ ] Run first analysis

---

## Exercise 2: GitHub Actions Integration ✅

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Enhanced existing `maven.yml` workflow with SonarCloud
- [x] Created dedicated `sonarcloud.yml` workflow
- [x] Added SonarCloud package caching for performance
- [x] Configured quality gate waiting (`-Dsonar.qualitygate.wait=true`)
- [x] Added scheduled weekly scans
- [x] Implemented manual trigger capability
- [x] Enhanced error reporting and notifications

### Workflow Features:
```yaml
Triggers:
  - Push to master/main
  - Pull requests
  - Weekly schedule (Sunday midnight)
  - Manual dispatch

Enhanced Features:
  - SonarCloud package caching
  - Quality gate enforcement
  - Comprehensive error reporting
  - Security-focused notifications
```

### Verification Required:
- [ ] Push changes to trigger workflow
- [ ] Verify workflow runs successfully in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Check SonarCloud analysis completes
- [ ] Confirm quality gate results appear

---

## Exercise 3: Security Vulnerability Analysis ✅

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Created `VulnerableController.java` with intentional security issues
- [x] Added comprehensive test coverage (`VulnerableControllerTest.java`)
- [x] Implemented various vulnerability types for demonstration

### Security Issues Implemented:

#### Critical Vulnerabilities:
1. **SQL Injection** - `getUserById()` method
   ```java
   String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + id; // Vulnerable
   ```

2. **Path Traversal** - `readFile()` method
   ```java
   Path filePath = Paths.get("/app/files/" + fileName); // Vulnerable
   ```

#### Security Hotspots:
1. **Hard-coded Credentials**
   ```java
   private static final String DB_PASSWORD = "admin123";
   private static final String API_KEY = "sk-1234567890abcdef";
   ```

2. **Weak Cryptography** - MD5 usage
   ```java
   MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5"); // Weak
   ```

3. **Command Injection Risk**
   ```java
   Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("echo " + command); // Risky
   ```

4. **Information Disclosure**
   ```java
   // Exposing system properties and client information
   ```

### Analysis Tasks Required:
- [ ] Run SonarCloud analysis
- [ ] Document all identified vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review security hotspots
- [ ] Create prioritized remediation plan
- [ ] Take screenshots of security findings

---

## Exercise 4: Quality Gate Configuration ✅

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Configured workflows to wait for quality gate results
- [x] Added quality gate enforcement in CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Implemented failure handling and notifications

### Quality Gate Settings (To Be Configured in SonarCloud):

#### Security-First Conditions:
```
New Code:
├─ Security Rating = A (Zero vulnerabilities)
├─ Vulnerabilities = 0
├─ Security Hotspots Reviewed = 100%
└─ Security Review Rating = A

Overall Code:
├─ Security Rating ≤ C
└─ Vulnerabilities ≤ 5
```

### Manual Configuration Required:
- [ ] Access SonarCloud → Organization → Quality Gates
- [ ] Create "Security-First Gate"
- [ ] Add security-focused conditions
- [ ] Apply to cicd-demo project
- [ ] Test quality gate enforcement

---

## Exercise 5: Continuous Monitoring Setup ✅

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Implemented scheduled scanning (weekly)
- [x] Added manual trigger capability
- [x] Enhanced notification system
- [x] Created comprehensive security reporting
- [x] Implemented failure handling with detailed messages

### Monitoring Features:
```yaml
Scheduled Scans:
  - Frequency: Weekly (Sunday 00:00 UTC)
  - Trigger: GitHub Actions cron job
  - Quality Gate: Enforced with failure notifications

Manual Triggers:
  - Workflow dispatch enabled
  - On-demand security assessments
  - Emergency security scans

Notifications:
  - Failure notifications with dashboard links
  - Quality gate status reporting
  - Security findings summary
```

### Verification Steps:
- [ ] Test manual workflow trigger
- [ ] Verify scheduled scan configuration
- [ ] Check notification messages
- [ ] Monitor security trends over time

---
